# 🧠 Python Object Detection with OpenCV (Frozen Inference Graph + COCO)

This project demonstrates **object detection** using **Python 3.8**, **OpenCV**, and a **frozen inference graph** (e.g. `ssd_mobilenet_v3_large_coco_2020_01_14`) trained on the COCO dataset. The script detects objects in real-time from your webcam or video input using a pre-trained TensorFlow model.
